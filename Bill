“C” Program for representing Bill Generator
•	Ordinary Bills: These deal with any subject other than those related to financial matters. They are the most common type of bill and require passage in both houses of Parliament and the President's assent to become law. 
•	Money Bills: These exclusively concern financial matters like taxation, public expenditure, and borrowing from the Consolidated Fund of India. They have special provisions, including requiring the approval of only the Lok Sabha and the President's assent. 
•	Financial Bills: These are a separate category from Money Bills but also deal with financial issues. They may include provisions for economic matters along with other topics and require passage in both houses of Parliament and the President's assent.

2. Essential elements of daily use bill
1.	Bill/Invoice Number
Unique identifier for the bill.
2.	Billing Date
When the bill was generated.
3.	Due Date
The last date by which payment should be made.
4.	Customer Information
5.	Name
6.	Address
7.	Customer ID or account number
8.	Supplier/Service Provider Information

14.	Billing Period
The specific time frame the bill covers (e.g., July 1 - July 31).

2. Core Concepts 
•	User input: The program must take input from the user, such as the amount of units consumed, product prices and quantities, or customer details. This is usually done using the scanf() function.
•	Variable declaration: You need to declare appropriate variables to store the data, such as int for units and float or double for monetary values.
•	Conditional logic: The pricing structure for bills is often tiered, meaning the rate changes based on usage. if-else or switch-case statements are used to apply these different rates correctly.
•	Arithmetic operations: The program performs calculations like multiplication and addition to determine the final cost, including surcharges or taxes.
•	Formatted output: The program uses printf() to display the final bill in a clear, formatted way, often including a breakdown of charges.
•	Structures (for more advanced projects): For a more complex billing system, a struct can be used to group related data for a single customer or product, such as their name, ID, units consumed, and total amount.
•	File handling (for advanced projects): An advanced version might save customer records and bills to a file for later retrieval. Functions like fwrite() and fread() can be used to handle file I/O.
